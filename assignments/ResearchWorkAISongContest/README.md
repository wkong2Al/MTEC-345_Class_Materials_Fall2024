# MTEC-345 Research Work: AI Song Contest

Having chosen your song, research the song, how it was made, the underlying technology, and the and team that created it. Present what you learned to the class. Your presentation must include slides, and may also include your creative musical work that uses the same (or similar) underlying technologies.

## Submission Guideline
In the [github.com/MTEC-345/MTEC-345_Homework](https://github.com/MTEC-345/MTEC-345_Homework_Fall2024) repository, under a folder with your name, create a new folder named `ResearchWork1`. Add your journal, project assets, and presentation slides to this folder. Create a new branch, commit, push, and make a pull request to complete your submission.

### Project Assets
In the `ResearchWork1` folder, include all files required to run your project, including any source code, configuration files, sample inputs, databases, etc. If your project is bigger than **100MB** in memory, contact your instructor immediately to seek alternative ways to submit your project assets.

### Presentation Slides
Upload your presentation slides (.key or .ppt file) to your Google Drive. Create a README.md file in the `ResearchWork` folder. Put the link to the slides in the README.md file. If you used Google Slides for your presentation, put the link to your slides instead. Please change the permissions on your link so that your instructor and everyone in the class can view your slides.

## Objective:
Throughout the semester, we will explore the intersection of music and machine learning. A foundational step is understanding prior work in this domain. This exercise will have you delve into past projects or concepts, aiming to inspire your future creations. Starting week 3, each student will present their research findings to the class.

## Research Focus: AI Song Contest 2023
The AI Song Contest, initiated in 2020, is a pioneering global competition that blends the realms of AI and music composition. With teams spanning musicians to data scientists, the contest aims to craft songs with AI intricately woven into their creation process.



**For this assignment, delve into a chosen participant's creation journey. Here’s your research blueprint:**

1. **Technological Analysis:** Dive deep into the tools and technology leveraged to weave the song. How did AI play a role?
2. **Evaluation:** Critically analyze the song creation process. What aspects made it riveting or lackluster?
3. **Practical Application:** Are the AI tools used to create this song available to the public? If not, are there similar tools available and open source? Extra poitns are awarded if you use the same or similar technology to craft your unique song–This will be both challenging and rewarding, offering hands-on experience.
4. **Reflection:** Chronicle your journey — the hurdles, epiphanies, and key takeaways from your song creation endeavor.
5. **Presentation:** Convey your research insights and showcase your song to the class.

## Additional Notes:
- **Collaboration:** You may choose to collaborate with peers, but mention your role distinctly.
- **Resources:** Begin with the official AI Song Contest website and branch into related scholarly articles, forums, or tech blogs for deeper insights.

Good luck, and may this journey attune you to the symphony of technology and creativity!

## Presentation Guideline
Once you have done your research, it is time to prepare your presentation to report to the class. Think of this as telling the class what you have learned. The presentation should include a short intro, a brief description of the song you analyzed, a deep dive into the technology and tools used to create the music, a demonstration of the song you made, visual aids related to your research, and implications of your research work. Aim your presentation to be around 15 minutes long—if you have 10 slides, plan on spending about 1.5 minutes per slide. The trick to giving good presentations is distilling your information into a few bulleted lists and visual aids. You do not want to rush while presenting. You may use [this slide template](./ResearchPresentation.key) as a starting point to prepare for your presentation.

Your presentation may have the following slides:

### 1. Title slide
* Presentation title.
* Your name.
* Class name.
* Presentation date.

### 2. Introduction
* Set the context for your research.
* Share your research objectives.
* Highlight any themes or patterns that emerged.
* Include relevant visuals like photographs or drawings to enhance understanding.

### 3. Presentation of the Song
* Introduce and play the song under study.
* Discuss its creators and its distinctiveness.
* Delve into the song's musical elements: instrumentation, melody, scale, rhythm, structure.
* Share your opinions: what resonated with you or didn't?

### 4. Technology & Tools Deep Dive
* Goal of the song's production.
* Resource constraints encountered during production.
* Detailed data analysis: sources, preprocessing, feature processing (perhaps with a block diagram).
* Discuss the machine learning systems employed.
* Highlight challenges faced and solutions adopted.
* Compare with how you would approach a similar project.

### 5. Project Demonstration
* Showcase your creation, either live or via prerecorded content.
* Discuss your creation process.
* Highlight your achievements and learning.
* Indicate any future plans related to your project.

### 6. Summary, Implications, and Conclusion
* Recap key points of your research.
* Reflect on your overall learning journey.
* Discuss potential future work stemming from this research.

## Effective Presentation Tips
* **Rehearse:** Familiarity with content improves flow and timing.
* **Project Confidence:** Clear speech conveys authority and understanding.
* **Engage Your Audience:** Make eye contact and respond to their non-verbal cues.
* **Leverage Aids:** Utilize visuals or audio tools to underscore your points.
* **Avoid Reading:** Aim for a conversational tone rather than a script recitation.
* **Interactive Element:** Consider adding a Q&A section or interactive polls for audience participation.

Remember, while content is crucial, the manner of presentation plays a pivotal role in message retention. Your ultimate goal is not just to share information but to make it resonate with your audience.
