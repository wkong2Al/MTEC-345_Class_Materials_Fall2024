## Lab Exercise: GitHub 

### Objective
Learn and document the GitHub workflow. By the end of this lab exercise, you should understand cloning, branching, contributing to repositories, and using GitHub as a platform for collaboration.


### Instructions
Follow the tasks below and maintain a journal of your progress. Refer to the documentation template for structuring your work and the lecture slides for best practices.

#### 1. Setting Up
1. Create a new account on [github.com](https://github.com/). Share your GitHub username with the instructor via email to gain access to the class repository.
2. Download and launch the [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/). Sign in using your GitHub account.
3. Use the GitHub Desktop app to clone the class materials repository. Access it via the `Clone a Repository from the Internetâ€¦` button and provide the URL [github.com/MTEC-345/MTEC-345_Class_Materials](https://github.com/MTEC-345/MTEC-345_Class_Materials_Fall2024).
4. Confirm the successful cloning by checking the `~/Documents/GitHub/` directory (`~` means home folder).
5. Update the repository regularly to get new class materials. Use the `Fetch origin` and then the `Pull origin` buttons.

#### Contributing to the Homework Repository
1. Clone the [github.com/MTEC-345/MTEC-345_Homework](https://github.com/MTEC-345/MTEC-345_Homework_Spring2024) repository to your local system.
2. You should have write access to this repository for your weekly journal submissions. Contact the instructor if you do not.
3. Create a root-level folder bearing your name in the repository.
4. In your named folder, establish a subfolder titled `Homework1`.
5. Within `Homework1`, craft a markdown file named `README.md`. **Note:** All your journals should be named `README.md`.
6. In your `README.md`, chronicle your journal submission process in detail. Incorporate screenshots and reference websites. **Important:** Initiate a new branch for your work and create a pull request. Ensure proper markdown syntax.
7. Conclude this exercise by sending a pull request. Your instructor will review and integrate your contribution into the main branch.

#### 3. Additional Tasks (Optional but Recommended)
1. Practice creating meaningful commit messages as you make changes.
2. Experiment with resolving conflicts in GitHub.
3. Explore GitHub: Browse repositories, use the search function, and star interesting repositories.
4. Introduce yourself to GitHub Pages and the process of hosting simple web pages.

Remember, the key to mastering GitHub is regular practice and exploration!
