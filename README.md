## Description
Machine learning is one of the most influential modern computing innovations. It shapes many aspects of our daily lives, including the musical realm. Practical machine learning systems can abstract an understanding of data and the world around us to create new predictions for the future of art, entertainment, creativity, communication, etc.

In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of machine learning with a focus on music, art, and creative applications. Students will gain practical experience in creating, composing, producing, and personalizing art and music using machine learning tools. Students will investigate contemporary machine-learning tools and their relevance in the arts, then develop individual machine-learning projects centered on music.

## Preamble

Some contents of the curriculum may change in small ways based on our progress throughout the semester and based on new and ongoing developments in the field of Machine Learning. The course policies, expectations, and grading metrics will not change.

## Expectations
All students are expected to

- attend fourteen lectures,
- take a syllabus quiz,
- work on six laboratory exercises,
- present 1-2 research works,
- design and implement two machine learning-based music systems,
- and participate in the mid-term and final project presentation.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- grasp the diversity and potential of machine learning systems applied to music,
- understand the basic algorithmic process of machine learning systems,
- understand the processing of data related to human actions, sensors, and music,
- analyze and generate music using machine learning,
- make sense of GitHub pages that document open source Audio AI projects,
- and use off-the-shelf tools and software to develop machine learning-based musical and artistic applications.

## Recommended Books
No books are required in this course, but the following books may be resourceful to students:

[**Machine Learning, Revised And Updated Edition**](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-revised-and-updated-edition) provides a good introduction to Machine Learning.

## Course Materials
The course materials will be posted on [GitHub](https://github.com) and not [Canvas](https://canvas.berklee.edu). Use [this link](https://github.com/MTEC-345/MTEC-345_Class_Materials_Fall2024) to access class materials. If you do not have access to the class material GitHub repository, contact the instructor immediately.

## Course Requirements
The primary assessment criteria will be participating in the two projects over the course of the semester. In addition, all students will research music and machine learning-related topics, which they will present to the class during the semester. Attendance and participation are critical. This course provides a template for the type of interaction you may experience working at a technology start-up.

### Research Work
During the semester, you will be conducting research on music and machine learning. This exercise aims to gather and analyze influential past projects/concepts that may then serve as an inspiration for your projects. Every week starting week 3, at least one student will share their research work with the rest of the class.

### Laboratory Exercises
There are lab exercises for most weeks of the semester. These are practical exercises that will help you to learn the technical material of the class. You should review the weekly materials, do the labs, and write about your progress, failures, and questions. Class time most weeks will start with your questions and progress from the labs.

### Documentation
Document your progress in the class using Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, and README as you go. At a minimum, you should summarize any insights and questions you have from each week's lab assignments and document your production projects and technical research thoroughly. You can find guidelines for good documentation, and several examples, in the class material GitHub repository.

### Projects
You will complete two project in this class. The lab material will provide the necessary techniques, and the class discussion will help you develop ideas for each. You will show your project assignments in class in weeks 8 and 14. You will be expected to document your projects.

#### Mid-term Project
The midterm project aims to get students familiarized with machine learning systems in the context of music and art. Students will work to design and present a machine learning-based musical application. The project must include presentations and demos. This exercise aims to learn to rapidly iterate on ideas in a team environment while encouraging you to think broadly about using machine learning systems.

Week 6| Proposal
Week 7| Review
Week 8| Implementation
#### Final Project
The final project is an open-ended result of the class experience and knowledge. Based on the frame of reference established in the first half of the semester, students will elaborate on a decided-upon topic of interest. The final result will include a new application of machine learning in the context of music.

## Project and Journal Submission Policy
The instructor will post descriptions for projects and lab exercises on the class material GitHub repository. The instructions will not be on [Canvas](canvas.berklee.edu). <u>Please follow all project instructions.</u> If something is missing, you will be notified and given the opportunity to resubmit, but with a late penalty.

### General
- Students must submit their projects and journals using [GitHub](github.com) and not [Canvas](canvas.berklee.edu).
- Late submission will incur a penalty of 5 points each day.
- Projects and journals are due on the date specified before the class. If your class starts at 9:00 am, then you must submit it before that class time.
- Your assignments are one day late if you submit them after the class starts on the date specified. For example, if your class begins at 9:00 am, and you submit your assignment on 9:01 am, your assignment is one date late, and you will lose 5 points.
- After the next class cycle (two days after the due date), your assignments/projects are two days late, and you will lose 10 points.
- The instructor will not accept your assignment one week after the due date (cut-off day).
- After the cut-off day, you will receive a grade of 0.
- Make-up submission after the due date will incur late penalties.
- No make-up submission is allowed after the cut-off time.
- The latest submission of your assignment will be graded.

### Mid-term and Final Projects
- The submission policy for mid-term and final projects is the same as problem sets.
- Late submission for the final project is not accepted, except in cases of emergency.

### General Advice
- No extra credit work exists in this course.
- Every late submission will burden your time to complete the next ones.
- Students are encouraged to submit their assignments and projects on time, even if they are incomplete.
- If you are having issues with your assignments, meet with the tutor or speak with your instructor immediately.
- Remember that the topics covered in this class are extensive and versatile.
- It is nearly impossible to master them all in a semester.
- It is expected that students may not understand everything covered in the class.
- Do not get discouraged when you do not understand everything, and make it a habit to seek help when you are stuck.

## Grade Determination
The grade is determined as follows:

Description|Grade
:--|:--
Syllabus Quiz | 5%
Research Work | 20%
Lab exercises | 25%
Mid-term Project | 25%
Final Project | 25%

Research work, lab exercises, and projects are evaluated using grading rubrics. The rubrics will ordinarily involve your software programs' correctness, design, style, and documentation. Keep in mind that the [Canvas](https://canvas.berklee.edu) is used to give you feedback (click on the <u>Grades</u> on the left to view feedback) on your grades.

This class draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those less comfortable," "those more comfortable," and those in between. However, what ultimately matters in this course is not where you end up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself when you began.

## Attendance Policy
Class attendance and participation are essential to your success in this course. Attendance is required for the full semester, including final exam week. You will need to plan accordingly for any end-of-semester travel plans. Your instructor will allow one absence during the semester. After that, you will lose one grade increment for any additional absences. If your graded work for the semester qualifies you for an 'A' and you have three absences, your final grade will be a 'B+.'

Suppose you are going to miss a class. In that case, you need to notify your teacher in advance, or if that is not possible, as soon as possible after the class meeting you did not attend.

- Students are late if they come into class after the attendance is taken.
- Students early departed if they leave before the instructor dismisses the class.
- A student will be marked absent if the departure is severely early (e.g., left the class right after attendance check).
- Students made an early departure if they do not tell the instructor before the class starts and take off before it officially ends.
- Three late or early departure count as one absence.
- Students must be present for the final project presentation day. If students are absent, they will lose 5% of their total grade.

## AI-Assisted Learning Policy
Using AI to generate solutions without effort and comprehension is not only against academic integrity policies but also diminishes their learning experience. Use Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to understand programming concepts better, clarify ambiguous lecture content, and explore different approaches to problems. They should not be used to generate complete solutions to homework, project assignments, or examination questions. Solutions must result from a student's critical thinking and problem-solving.

All code submitted must be understood thoroughly by the student. This includes explaining the code's logic, why specific decisions were made, and how different parts of the code interact. If students use LLMs or other AI tools to help develop a portion of their code, they must cite this assistance in their code comments. The instructors are open to questions if students are unsure whether their use of AI tools adheres to the course policy. We encourage students to ask these questions to ensure they use these powerful tools responsibly and effectively. Failure to comply with this policy will be treated the same as any other violation of academic integrity. It may result in a grade reduction, course failure, or other disciplinary action.
